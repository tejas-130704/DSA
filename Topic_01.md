# Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms.

**DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms)** is the study of organizing data efficiently using data structures like arrays, stacks, and trees, paired with step-by-step procedures (or algorithms) to solve problems effectively. Data structures manage how data is stored and accessed, while algorithms focus on processing this data.

### Why to Learn DSA?
    -   Learning DSA boosts your problem-solving abilities and make you a stronger programmer.
    -   DSA is foundation for almost every software like GPS, Search Engines, AI ChatBots, Gaming Apps, Databases, Web Applications, etc

| **Time Complexity** | **Example**                        | **Growth Rate**          |
|----------------------|------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| `O(1)`              | Accessing an array element        | Constant                |
| `O(log n)`          | Binary search                     | Very slow               |
| `O(n)`              | Traversing a list                 | Moderate                |
| `O(n log n)`        | Merge Sort                        | Faster than `O(n^2)`    |
| `O(n^2)`            | Nested loops                      | Slow                    |
| `O(n^3)`            | Matrix multiplication             | Very slow               |
| `O(2^n)`            | Recursive Fibonacci               | Extremely slow          |
| `O(n!)`             | Generating permutations           | Impractical             |
